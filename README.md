# hello-world
This is another repository, my "Hello World" repository.

Hello ðŸ‘‹ World!
Thanks for stopping by and reading my README.md (markdown).
Let's connect and share code! =^D

Before I go...
My name is Joseph Stewart. I study IT, computer science, and engineering at BYU-Idaho.
One of my favorite hobbies is to play machine dance game like Dance Dance Revolution.
Hit me up for more discussion! :D

Commit change notes: I added a small bio and "Hello World!" This will only appear on readme-edits branch, different from main.
